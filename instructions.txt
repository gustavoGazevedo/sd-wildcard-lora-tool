how to use:

Install the following Extensions:
 - Stable Diffusion Dynamic Prompts (https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts)
 - Civitai Helper (https://github.com/butaixianran/Stable-Diffusion-Webui-Civitai-Helper)

Start automatic1111
Go to extension tab "Civitai Helper". There is a button called "Scan model".
In model types select lora and click "scan" (this will download preview images for your loras and a .info file that will contain the trigger words)

After this is finished, go to the config.json file, add to the whitelist the path to your lora folder, and to the blacklist what folders to ignore.

Run run.bat, and then copy the generated files to "/path/to/stable-diffusion-webui/extensions/sd-dynamic-prompts/wildcard"

other configs:

subfolders: if true, will search all subfolders.
createWildcardForSubfolders: if true will create a separate wildcard for each subfolder
WildcardName: the name of the wildcard txt file, subfolders will be named after their folder name
maximumNumberOfCombinations: set to zero to get all possible trigger word variations
weights: what weights are supposed to be used in the loras, will create maximumNumberOfCombinations x number of weights
